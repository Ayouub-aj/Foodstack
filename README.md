# 🍽️ Foodstack — Recipe Sharing Platform

> **Welcome to Foodstack**, a project executed by the **DigitalBite Agency** to centralize culinary creations in a single, secure, and professional platform.

---

## 🏢 Project Context

The **DigitalBite Agency** specializes in creating applications for the culinary industry. Our client, **Marrakech Food Lovers**, needs to solve a growing problem: beloved recipes are currently scattered across paper notebooks, phone photos, and disorganized Word files, making sharing and access within the community almost impossible.

### ⚠️ The Problem
- **Fragmentation**: Recipes are stored in various non-standard formats.
- **Inaccessibility**: Hard to find and search for a specific dish.
- **No Community**: No way to share and organize recipes among enthusiasts.

### 🚀 The Solution
A centralized, professional web platform built with a robust **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture to ensure data integrity and ease of use.

## 👨‍💻 Backend Developer Role & Architecture

Our role as Backend Developers focuses on high-standard software engineering:
- **Architecting the MVC Flow**: Complete isolation of responsibilities. Orchestrating data without compromise between the Model and the View via the Controller.
- **OOP Encapsulation**: Shielding data access with `private` properties and standardizing interaction through public `Getters/Setters`.
- **SQL Data Engineering**: High-fidelity modelling of **1-N relationships** (Users to Recipes, Categories to Recipes) with full referential integrity.
- **Operational Agility**: We use the **Kanban methodology** via **Jira** to track progress and sync during **Daily Standups**.
- **Merise Method**: Structural analysis using **MCD** (Conceptual Data Model) and **MLD** (Logical Data Model) before starting the development phase.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ayouub-aj/Foodstack.git
   ```
2. **Database Import**:
   - Create a database named `foodstack`.
   - Import `app/database/shema.sql` to create tables and constraints.
   - Import `app/database/seed.sql` to populate sample data.
3. **Configuration**:
   - Open `app/config/config.php`.
   - Update your local credentials (`DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`).
4. **Run the application**:
   - Point your local server (XAMPP/Laragon) to the `app/public/` folder.
   - Access via: `http://localhost:8080/projectPHP/Foodstack/app/public`.

## 🛡️ Performance & Security Criteria

- **Zero SQL Injection**: 100% of queries use **PDO Prepared Statements**.
- **Secure Auth**: Passwords are saved using `password_hash()` (BCRYPT) and verified via `password_verify()`.
- **MVC Integrity**: No SQL queries allowed in Views; business logic is restricted to Models.
- **XSS Prevention**: Clean output using `htmlspecialchars()` on all dynamic content.
